# Abstract

Following the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, clean energy is now
widely perceived not only as the way towards a carbon-neutral world, but also as a lucra-
tive investment opportunity. This can be reflected in the price movements of clean energy
stocks. Numerous indices, which track the green energy sector, have been outperforming
the broad market by significant margins for the past two years and have delivered impres-
sive returns at their peak in 2021.

Green energy has enormous upside potential, which causes a lot of investors to flock
into the market in an effort to gain exposure to the seemingly limitless growth of the clean
energy industry. However, the question arises if this sudden investor interest might be the
basis for a asset bubble in the sector.

The following study investigates this question with regard to the solar energy market
in particular, as solar energy might be a natural choice for investors due to the maturity
and reliability of the technology. The paper studies price and returns data from January
2017 to January 2022 of the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), which mirrors the MAC Global
Solar Energy Stock Index (SUNIDX). First a 5-Factor Fama-French model is employed
on weekly returns data in order to determine what the return dynamics and risks of solar
energy stocks are. Additionally, a sup-augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF) test and a gen-
eralized sup-augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) test are applied on daily prices in order
to identify explosive price behavior.

The 5-Factor Fama-French model proves that solar energy companies carry signifi-
cant idiosyncratic risk. The SADF and GSADF provide strong evidence to suggest the
occurrence of multiple-bubble episodes during the sample period.
